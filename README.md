Case Study on Top 250 Movies according to IMDB

I wanted to analyze the the trend of the top movies according to IMDB. I was trying to answer questions such as how does the ranking of movies look like in the future, and the correlation between the budget of the movie and box office numbers. 
Data was extracted from Kaggle. Data was then cleaned and validated using Excel. Sorting, filtering, deletion of columns, and pivot tables were used in this process.
Cleaned data was then sent to Tableau to create graphs and a dashboard to display findings.

Conclusion was that movies in the future are looking to have a difficult time making top 250 movies. Movies that spent more on production didn't correlate with higher box office numbers. The future movies that will  make the top 250 list will most likely be Drama genre. 

All data analysis process was recorded in a well typed up word document. The pdf as well as the Excel project is included here.
